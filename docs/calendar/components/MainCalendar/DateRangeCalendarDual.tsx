/**
 * Main page wrapper for DateRangeCalendarDual
 *
 * This component imports both the original CSS (with system dark mode support)
 * and the Nextra-specific CSS (with data-theme dark mode support).
 *
 * For Sandpack examples, use the original component directly which only
 * includes the base CSS with @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark).
