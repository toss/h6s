## Features

- Radix Popover gives accessible overlay behavior (focus trap, escape to close).
- Calendar generated by `@h6s/calendar` with month navigation and today highlight.
- Clear and Today actions included in the popover.
- Styling uses vanilla CSS with light/dark support via `prefers-color-scheme`.
- Popover width adjusts to viewport and allows horizontal scrolling when space is limited.
