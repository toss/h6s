# Vanilla CSS

Single date picker with a field trigger and floating calendar popover built using plain CSS.

## Interactive Example

Try editing the code below to see how the date picker changes:

<Sandpack
  files={[
    {
      path: "app/docs/examples/date-picker/vanilla/DatePicker.tsx",
      target: "/App.tsx",
    },
    {
      path: "app/docs/examples/date-picker/vanilla/DatePicker.css",
      target: "/DatePicker.css",
    },
  ]}
  dependencies={{
    "@radix-ui/react-popover": "^1.1.2",
  }}
  previewOptions={{
    style: {
      height: 550,
    }
  }}
/>

## Features

- Radix Popover gives accessible overlay behavior (focus trap, escape to close).
- Calendar generated by `@h6s/calendar` with month navigation and today highlight.
- Clear and Today actions included in the popover.
- Styling uses vanilla CSS with light/dark support via `prefers-color-scheme`.
- Popover width adjusts to viewport and allows horizontal scrolling when space is limited.
