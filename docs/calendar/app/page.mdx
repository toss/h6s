# @h6s/calendar

## Logic-first Calendar Hook for React

**Your calendar, your way.**

@h6s/calendar is a headless calendar library that provides pure logic without any UI. Build any calendar interface you want with complete styling freedom.

## Key Features

### 🧠 Pure Logic
Only one hook, `useCalendar()`, controls everything. No UI constraints, just clean calendar state management.

### 🔌 Integrate Anything
Works seamlessly with any design system:
- Tailwind CSS
- Chakra UI
- shadcn/ui
- Vanilla Extract
- CSS-in-JS (Emotion/styled-components)

### 🪨 Stable Core
UI changes don't affect the logic. Zero UI dependencies means a stable, maintainable core.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @h6s/calendar
# or
yarn add @h6s/calendar
# or
pnpm add @h6s/calendar
```

```tsx
import { useCalendar } from '@h6s/calendar';

function MyCalendar() {
  const { headers, body, navigation, view } = useCalendar();

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your custom UI here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## What Can You Build?

- **DatePicker** - Single date selection with 5 CSS framework examples
- **DateRangePicker** - Date range selection with 5 CSS framework examples

Each example shows how to integrate @h6s/calendar with popular styling solutions.

## Why Headless?

Headless components separate logic from presentation, giving you:

- **Complete Design Freedom** - Style it exactly how you want
- **Framework Agnostic** - Works with any CSS solution
- **Smaller Bundle Size** - No unnecessary UI code
- **Better Maintainability** - Logic and UI evolve independently
